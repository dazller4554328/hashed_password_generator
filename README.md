# hashed_password_generator
This script generates a deterministic, complex password from any input word or phrase.
The password is derived from a SHA-256 hash of the input text, which ensures that the same input always generates the same password. The script uses a set of letters, numbers, and special characters to create a password of a specified length (default: 16 characters).

Hereâ€™s how it works:

The input text is converted into a SHA-256 hash.
The hash is used to seed the random number generator to ensure that the password is always the same for the same input.
A password is generated by randomly selecting characters from a predefined set of letters, numbers, and symbols.
The final password is output with the specified length (default 16 characters).
